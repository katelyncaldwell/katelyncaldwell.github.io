## About Me

Hi, I’m Kate, a graduate student in CS, focusing on Machine Learning. This summer, I’m researching Explainable AI methods for Natural Language Processing. I’m interested in what and how models encode information into their hidden representations. In my free time, I like to walk my dog around Pike Place Market and read books with my philosophy club.
